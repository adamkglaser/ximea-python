## ximea-python

Controlling Ximea cameras in Python requires the **ximea** package. This is available for both Windows and Linux.

The official Python SDK is not published on PyPI but comes bundled with the Ximea SDK. This is available on the Ximea [website](https://documentation.euresys.com/Products/COAXLINK/COAXLINK/en-us/Content/04_eGrabber/programmers-guide/Python.htm](https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Python).

It is provided here for convenience purposes and installing via git.
